# Food-Planner-APP
I designed and created an app using the Kotlin programming language for android mobile devices. It allows users to create and share meals, plan their days and keeping track of food consumption.

During a Mobile App Developement module, we were challenged to design and create an app for android. I liked being able to use 'intents' of the phones hardware within my app, e.g. Camera and seeing all the possibilities available. 

From this Project I learned how valuable online tools and articles are to assist with coding in a new language.
